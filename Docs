WarLens: Transfer Learning For Event Classification In Conflict Zones WarLens is an innovative project utilizing transfer learning techniques to classify events in conflict zones by analyzing multimedia data such as images and videos. By leveraging pre-trained deep learning models and fine-tuning them on data specific to conflict zones, WarLens can accurately identify and classify various events such as protests, military activities, humanitarian crises, and infrastructure damage.

Scenario 1: In a conflict zone, a non-governmental organization (NGO) is monitoring social media and news outlets for reports of violence and human rights abuses. WarLens provides them with a tool to automatically analyze multimedia content and classify events, enabling rapid response and intervention to assist affected populations and document human rights violations.

Scenario 2: A government agency is responsible for monitoring security and stability in a conflict-affected region. By integrating WarLens into their surveillance systems, they can analyze live feeds from security cameras and drones to detect and classify relevant events in real time, enabling the timely deployment of resources and response teams to mitigate threats and maintain order.

Scenario 3: A media organization is reporting on developments in a conflict zone and needs to verify the authenticity of user-generated content shared on social media platforms. WarLens helps them analyze images and videos to confirm the occurrence of events and provide context for their reporting, enhancing the accuracy and credibility of their news coverage.

Testing The Model Model Testing is the process of evaluating the performance of a deep learning model on a dataset that it has not seen before. It is a crucial step in the development of any machine learning model, as it helps to determine how well the model can generalize to new data. Screenshot 2024-07-12 at 8 53 49 PM

Screenshot 2024-07-12 at 8 55 56 PM Screenshot 2024-07-12 at 8 58 38 PM
In the above code, we have tested the model with 5 classes 'combat', 'destroyed_building', 'fire', 'humanitarian', and 'vehicles'. Opening and Preprocessing: First, it opens an image ('/content/war_events/Combat/10.jpeg') and resizes it to a standard size (224x224 pixels) suitable for the machine learning model being used. Converting to Model Input: Then, it converts the image from a format understandable by humans (like a jpeg) to a numerical format (array) that the machine learning model can process. It also scales the pixel values between 0 and 1 for better model performance. Finally, it adds an extra dimension to the array to match the model's input requirements. Prediction Time: With the preprocessed image, the code feeds it to the model_new1 (presumably trained to recognize war events) to get predictions. Decoding the Prediction: The model outputs a set of probabilities for different categories (e.g., combat, destroyed building). The code identifies the category with the highest probability and retrieves the corresponding label from a predefined list (class_labels). This gives you the predicted class, which is the most likely war event depicted in the image. Visualization: Finally, the code displays the original image and overlays the predicted class label as a title, allowing you to see the image and the model's interpretation side-by-side. It also hides the axis labels for a cleaner presentation.
